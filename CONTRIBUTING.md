## Project Structure

This project follows the Atomic Design Principles. This principle has to be adhered to if your pull request is to be merged.

The structure below explains the atomic design principle.
**(NOTE: before creating any new compnent, please check if it exists already to avoid duplicate components.)**

In the root directory is an src folder which conteins the following sub-folders;

- **atoms:** this folder should house the smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs, text.

- **molecules:** in this folder resides components that are composed of two or more atoms, for example, a search Box comprising of an HTML TextInput and a Button.

- **organism:** here, you should have your bigger UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms, this could be a Navigation Bar, Side Bar, a section of a page.

- **pages:** here, it all finally comes together. This is where all components come together to make a complete page.


## Style Guide

**See the complete style guide on [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/cK9hICwy4Tcs7Nw2mXh0Aj/I4G-Open-Source)**

- In your forked repository, create a branch for your upcoming patch. (e.g. feature--autoplay or bugfix--ios-crash)
- Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
